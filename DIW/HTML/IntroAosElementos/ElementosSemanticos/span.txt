In HTML, the <span> element is used to group and apply styling to a specific
section of text within a larger block of content. Unlike block-level elements
such as <div>, <p>, or headings, <span> is an inline element that does not create
line breaks or separate content into distinct blocks.

The primary purpose of the <span> element is to provide a hook for CSS styling
or JavaScript manipulation. It allows you to target specific portions of text
and apply formatting, such as changing the color, font, or background, or adding
effects like highlighting or underlining.

For example, if you have a paragraph of text and want to make a particular word
or phrase stand out, you can wrap it with <span> tags and apply CSS styles to
those tags. This enables you to selectively modify the appearance or behavior of
the enclosed text without affecting the rest of the content.

Here's an example of how you can use <span> with CSS:

<p>This is a <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> text.</p>

<style>
  .highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
</style>

In this case, the word "highlighted" will be rendered with a yellow
background and bold font due to the CSS styles applied to the <span> element
with the class "highlight".

Overall, <span> provides a way to target and style specific sections of text
within HTML content, offering more granular control over presentation and behavior.
