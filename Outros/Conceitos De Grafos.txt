Temporal Graph | Grafo Temporal:
    - A temporal graph is a graph that changes over time, meaning that its nodes and edges can appear and disappear at different moments. A temporal graph can be used to model dynamic networks, such as vehicular networks, where the connections between vehicles depend on their positions and movements.

Density | Densidade:
    - The density of a graph is a measure of how many edges it has compared to the maximum possible number of edges. The density of a graph can range from 0 (no edges) to 1 (all possible edges). The density of a graph can indicate how well-connected or sparse the graph is. In vehicular networks, the density of a graph can vary depending on the traffic conditions and the communication range of the vehicles.

Components | Componentes:
    - A component of a graph is a subgraph that is connected, meaning that there is a path between any pair of nodes in the subgraph. A graph can have one or more components, depending on how its nodes and edges are distributed. The number and size of the components of a graph can reflect the structure and cohesion of the network. In vehicular networks, the components of a graph can change over time, as vehicles enter and leave the communication range of each other.

Trace | Traço:
    - A trace is a dataset that contains information about the trajectory of vehicles, such as their GPS coordinates, speed, and direction. A trace can be used to simulate or analyze the mobility and behavior of vehicles in a certain scenario. A trace can be real, meaning that it was collected from actual vehicles, or realistic, meaning that it was generated by a model or a simulator.

Edge Persistence | Persistência de Aresta:
    - Edge persistence is a metric that represents how often two vehicles encounter each other in the same time slot over different days. Edge persistence can be used to identify vehicles that have similar or frequent interactions, which can indicate common interests or routines. Edge persistence can be computed by counting the number of times an edge appears in the temporal graph.

Node Degree | Grau do Nó:
    - Node degree is a metric that determines the number of distinct contacts that a vehicle has during a time slot. Node degree can be influenced by the vehicle’s trajectory and the time of day. If a vehicle passes through a high-density traffic region or a rush hour, its degree tends to be high. Also, vehicles like taxis and buses tend to have higher degrees, because they travel many times during the day. Node degree can be computed by counting the number of edges incident to a node in the graph.

Betweenness | Intermediação:
    - Betweenness is a metric that measures the centrality of a node in the network. It is defined as the number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes that pass through that node. A node that has high betweenness has a large influence on the network, because it can be used to reach many other nodes quickly. Betweenness can be computed by using an algorithm that finds all shortest paths in the graph.

Cluster Coefficient | Coeficiente de Agrupamento:
    - Cluster coefficient is a metric that evaluates how close are the neighbors of a node, i.e., the probability that two neighbors of a node have already encountered each other. Cluster coefficient can indicate the presence of communities or groups of vehicles that share common interests or destinations. Cluster coefficient can also reflect the small world phenomenon, which means that the graph has short distances and high clustering. Cluster coefficient can be computed by dividing the number of triangles that include a node by the number of triples that include a node in the graph.

Topological Overlap | Sobreposição Topológica:
    - Topological overlap is a metric that measures the similarity of contacts among the vehicles in the graph. It is defined as the ratio of neighbors shared by two vehicles. Topological overlap can be used to find vehicles that have similar or frequent interactions, which can indicate common interests or routines. Topological overlap can be computed by using the formula shown in Equation 1 of the web page context.

Centrality | Centralidade:
    - Centrality is a general term that refers to various metrics that measure the importance or influence of a node in the network. Different centrality metrics can capture different aspects of the node’s role in the network, such as its connectivity, its position, its participation, or its prestige. Some examples of centrality metrics are degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and PageRank. Centrality metrics can be used to identify key nodes in the network, such as leaders, hubs, bridges, or outliers.

Small World Phenomenon | Fenômeno do Mundo Pequeno:
    - The small world phenomenon is a property of some networks that have short distances and high clustering. This means that any two nodes in the network can be reached by a few hops, and that nodes tend to form groups or communities with many connections among them. The small world phenomenon can be observed in many real-world networks, such as social networks, biological networks, or linguistic networks. The small world phenomenon can be explained by models such as the Watts-Strogatz model or the Barabási-Albert model.

VANET | VANET:
    - VANET stands for Vehicular Ad hoc Network, which is a type of network composed of vehicles that have communication, processing, and sensing capabilities. VANETs can enable vehicles to interact with each other and with roadside units, to provide safer and more efficient traffic, as well as various applications and services. VANETs have some challenges and characteristics, such as high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent connectivity, and heterogeneous scenarios.

Introduction: The authors introduce the concept of vehicular networks, where vehicles can communicate with each other and with roadside units, and the challenges and opportunities of this technology. They also present the idea of vehicular social networks, where vehicles can socialize and share common interests based on their mobility patterns and interactions.

Related Work: The authors review the existing literature on the analysis of vehicular mobility, social properties, and communication protocols in vehicular networks. They highlight the gaps and limitations of the previous works and the need for a deeper understanding of the interactions in vehicular networks.

Methodology: The authors describe the data sets, models, and metrics used to perform the vehicular mobility analysis. 

They use two traces: one real trace from Rome and one synthetic trace from Helsinki, both representing taxi mobility. They map the mobility and encounters of the vehicles into temporal graphs and compare them with random graphs. They also compute various macroscopic and microscopic metrics to capture the network topology, density, centrality, clustering, similarity, and persistence.
